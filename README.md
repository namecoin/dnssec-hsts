# DNSSEC-HSTS

DNSSEC-HSTS is a WebExtension that upgrades HTTP to HTTPS (simulating HSTS) for websites that support DANE (i.e. websites that list a TLSA record for TCP port 443).  This is a reasonably good heuristic for preventing sslstrip-style attacks.

**This code is experimental.**

## Installation

### Firefox

You'll first need to install the [native (Go) component](https://github.com/namecoin/dnssec-hsts-native) of DNSSEC-HSTS.  Then, if you're on GNU/Linux, do this:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/namecoin/dnssec-hsts.git
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts/
sudo cp -a ./dnssec-hsts /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts
sudo ln -s -T /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts "/usr/share/mozilla/extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}/dnssec-hsts"
~~~

You may need to restart Firefox, and/or enable the extension in the Addons dialog.  You're done!

If you're on another OS, you'll need to disable XPI extension signature checking in Firefox.  Then, do this:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/namecoin/dnssec-hsts.git
cd dnssec-hsts
zip dnssec-hsts@namecoin.org.xpi
~~~

Then open `dnssec-hsts@namecoin.org.xpi` in Firefox, and accept the extension installation dialog.

### Tor Browser

Follow the Firefox instructions for non-GNU/Linux OS's, even if you're on GNU/Linux.  You're done!

### Chromium

You'll first need to install [certdehydrate-dane-rest-api](https://github.com/namecoin/certdehydrate-dane-rest-api).

Then, if you're on GNU/Linux, do this:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/namecoin/dnssec-hsts.git
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts/
sudo cp -a ./dnssec-hsts /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts
sudo ln -s -T /usr/share/webext/dnssec-hsts /usr/share/chromium/extensions/dnssec-hsts
~~~

If you're on another OS, look up how to install unpacked extensions in Chromium.

### Other browsers

I have no idea whether DNSSEC-HSTS works in browsers besides Firefox and Chromium.  Test reports welcome!

## Warnings

DNSSEC-HSTS trusts your DNS resolver, and the network path to it.  This is perfectly fine if your DNS resolver is running on localhost (e.g. if you've installed DNSSEC-Trigger locally), but this is definitely *not* a good idea if your DNS resolver is operated by your ISP.
